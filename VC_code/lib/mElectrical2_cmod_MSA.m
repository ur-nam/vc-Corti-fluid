% % This is the analysis of whole three scalae circuit.This is giving output for dynamic condition.
% % This circuit is for solving the differential equation for the circuit formed in the function "tj_OClongnew_24thapril_real_dynamic2"
% % No input for this function explicitly but it reads the BM vibration from the mat file 'input', the output is time and node voltages
% % First written in April,2013 as a part of the course project BME 404
% % The circuit is a combination Mistrik et al. 2009 paper and NAMLAB circuit

   % Initial condition
