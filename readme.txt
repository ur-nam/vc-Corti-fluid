Virtual Cochlea simulation code:

This code is provided as part of the supplemental material for the paper titled "Corti fluid is a medium for outer hair cell force transmission"

The MATLAB file fig_K.m generates the tuning curves for Basilar membrane (BM), reticular lamina (RL), and the outer hair cell-Deiters cell joint (ODJ), similar to Figure 7.
The function is run by calling fig_K, with the option to restart the simulation or read previously saved simulation results.
The procedure for running the simulation can be learned from the fig_K.m code.
The main function for calling the Virtual Cochlea simulation process is: NLFD_virtualCochleaHarmonic.
